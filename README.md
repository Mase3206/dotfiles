# Noah's Dotfiles

You seem to have found my super secret dotfiles. Go you. It's pretty boring for the most part. 

## Pseudo-index of dotfiles

- Zsh - .zshrc, .oh-my-zsh/themes/terse.zsh-theme (custom)

## Dotfile helper scripts

I learned that manually managing dotfiles is kind of a pain. I tried to simplify this by:
1. Writing a not-so-simple Bash script;
2. Changing to Python, as I am stronger in it, but I decided it wasn't the best after waiting over ten minutes for it to *initialize*;
3. Chaning *back* to Bash, as it is the best way to do this.

While the current iteration does look a bit complex &mdash; and likely could be simpler &mdash; I made it as simple as I reasonably could without cutting out some niceties. Doing it in Bash (aside from it being the optimal language for this task) has given me a reason to dive into the language more, such as fully understanding conditionals and `case` statements. I'm no pro, but I'm slowly getting there.

If you like these helper scripts, you are more than welcome to use them verbatim or for inspiration.
